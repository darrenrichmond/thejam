# The Jam
thejam is a web app that helps amateur musicians get more experience.

This first version lets you see a list of open mic night events in your area
(just San Antonio, TX, for now) and add the ones you want to your Google 
Calendar. If you add an address to your profile, it will show you the drive 
time to that open mic.
